# Arduino

### [!NOTE]
If a file says "nm" it stands for not me, which means i did not works on that file/code
<br />
In the [1ELB](https://github.com/Hamid3DATA/Arduino/tree/main/1ELB) folder if a file says "ub" it means - without blocks, since in my first year i was using block coding

This is some random Arduino codes i made throughout my school years
