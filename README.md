# Arduino

### [!NOTE]
If a file says "nm" it means not me. Which means i did not work on that file/code
<br />
In the [1ELB](https://github.com/Hamid3DATA/Arduino/tree/main/1ELB) folder if a file says "ub" it means - without block coding, everything else was made with block coding. Since in my first year i was mostly using block coding

This is some random Arduino codes i made throughout my school years
